  <h1>Hōkūpaʻa Project Tracker</h1>
  <p>Welcome! This interactive tracker helps you monitor progress on our five touchstone goals. Click each petal on the next page to indicate progress: green (strong), yellow (in progress), red (needs support).</p>

  <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>

  <h3>Relationships & Joy</h3>
  <p>Cultivate a diverse learning environment that is engaging, energetic, and filled with moments of celebration. Prioritize strong relationships that foster trust, active listening, open communication, and developing the CORES.</p>

  <h3>Student-Centered & Personalized</h3>
  <p>Empowers student ownership through inquiry, project-based, and career-based learning that values diverse identities and perspectives. Uses flexible pacing, personalized support, and differentiation to meet individual learning needs.</p>

  <h3>Authentic & Purposeful</h3>
  <p>Connects content learning and the CORES to real-world applications, careers, and interdisciplinary experiences. Utilizes meaningful, performance and growth-based assessments beyond traditional tests.</p>

  <h3>Community & ʻĀina-Based</h3>
  <p>Rooted in Hawai‘i, we honor and integrate local culture and history. Fosters community partnerships, field studies, and service learning for purposeful engagement.</p>

  <h3>Blended & Innovative</h3>
  <p>Seamlessly combines in-person, virtual, and independent learning for engagement and flexibility. Necessitates creative problem-solving, experimentation, iteration, and the use of technology.</p>
